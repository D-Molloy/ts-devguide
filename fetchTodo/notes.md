### Definitions

- Type: Easy way to refer to the different properties + function that a value has. Every value in TS has a type.

### TS Types

- TS has two kinds of types:
  - Primitive types: number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null
  - Object types: functions, arrays, classes, objects (any types that we create)
- Object type, trick TS into thinking its the right kind of types

### Why care about types?

- Types are used by the Typescript Compiler to analyze our code for errors
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase
